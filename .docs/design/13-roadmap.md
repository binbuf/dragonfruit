# Roadmap and MVP Definition

## Summary

We distinguish a **demo MVP** from a **daily-driver MVP**. The temptation is
to spend months cloning every System Settings page before the desktop itself
feels good; we deliberately do almost the reverse.

## The first vertical slice

```text
Our compositor
├── single-monitor output
├── mouse + keyboard
├── floating windows
├── focus / move / resize / maximize / fullscreen
├── three workspaces
├── basic animations
├── Xwayland
└── private shell protocol

Our shell
├── top menu bar
├── Dock
├── clock
├── Wi-Fi menu
├── volume
├── battery
└── Mission Control button/gesture

First-party apps
├── Settings
└── Files
```

At that point we already have the essence of the product.

## The core interaction loop

Get this 30-second sequence absurdly polished — it matters more to product
identity than a complete printer configuration page:

```text
launch app
→ Dock animation
→ window appears
→ traffic lights
→ workspace switching
→ Mission Control
→ minimize
→ restore from Dock
→ app switch
→ close
```

## Daily-driver bar

| Area | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Displays | Multi-monitor, hotplug, scaling, rotation |
| Windowing | Xwayland, fullscreen, transient dialogs, popups |
| Input | Keyboard layouts, mouse, touchpad, gestures |
| Session | Clean startup/shutdown and crash behavior |
| Security | Trustworthy lock screen |
| Power | Idle, suspend/resume, battery |
| Desktop services | Notifications and OSD |
| Portals | Screenshot / screen sharing / file chooser integration |
| Networking | Wi-Fi / VPN basics |
| Bluetooth | Discovery / pair / connect |
| Audio | Input/output/volume/device switching |
| Storage | Removable media and mounting |
| Clipboard | Text, images, files |
| Accessibility | Keyboard navigation and AT-SPI-compatible first-party UI |
| Applications | Settings + usable file manager |
| Hardware | Intel/AMD baseline, then NVIDIA validation |

A contemporary desktop ships independent idle, OSD, notifications, screenshot,
portal, settings-daemon, greeter/session, and workspace components in addition
to the visually obvious compositor and panel — that is the reality check for
the breadth of "daily-driver."

## Implementation sequence

1. **Foundation** — Smithay compositor, nested backend, native DRM backend,
   input, outputs, windows, workspace model, Xwayland.
2. **Experience** — design system, top bar, Dock, window switching, Mission
   Control, workspace gestures, animations.
3. **Flagship apps** — Settings and Files, built entirely in our design
   system.
4. **System integration** — NetworkManager, BlueZ, PipeWire/WirePlumber,
   UPower, UDisks (all expose the APIs needed for custom frontends; see
   [07-system-integration.md](07-system-integration.md)).
5. **Desktop infrastructure** — notifications, idle/lock, portal backend,
   screenshot/screencast, polkit/auth UI integration, clipboard, session
   lifecycle.
6. **Compatibility** — third-party decoration themes, DBusMenu global-menu
   bridge, StatusNotifier/AppIndicator support, strange Xwayland applications.
7. **Polish** — multi-monitor transitions, fractional-scale edge cases,
   suspend/resume, graphics-driver testing, accessibility, localization,
   performance, crash recovery.

### Phase exit criteria

Each phase has a definition of done; phases do not "fade" into each other:

- **Foundation:** nested and DRM sessions both run the vertical slice;
  Xwayland windows map; session teardown is clean (no leaked VT master,
  no orphaned clients).
- **Experience:** the 30-second interaction loop runs with zero dropped
  frames on baseline Intel/AMD hardware; reduced-motion variants pass.
- **Flagship apps:** Settings fully configures every pane it ships; Files
  covers the MVP scope; both publish menu models and render identical
  traffic lights.
- **System integration:** every adapter degrades gracefully when its daemon
  is missing — verified by masking the systemd unit in a VM.
- **Desktop infrastructure:** the lock screen survives kill tests; portals
  work for a Flatpak browser (file chooser, screenshot, screen share).
- **Compatibility:** a DBusMenu-exporting Qt app shows a global menu; a
  StatusNotifier tray item renders in the menu bar.
- **Polish:** multi-monitor hotplug, 100 suspend/resume cycles, and
  fractional scaling pass scripted soak tests in a VM matrix.

## Performance budgets

Targets, checked on baseline Intel/AMD hardware, enforced inside the dev
loop rather than discovered in the polish phase:

| Path | Budget |
|---|---|
| Workspace switch / Mission Control | 60 Hz, no dropped frames for the full gesture |
| Input-to-photon latency | Under one frame, nested and DRM |
| Idle desktop | Zero damage, zero client wakeups from our shell |
| Animation system | One frame of compositor work per frame of animation |

## Engineering estimates

Assuming one very strong full-time Linux/Wayland engineer:

| Milestone | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Convincing prototype | 1–3 months |
| Plausibly daily-drivable (controlled Fedora hardware) | 6–12 months |
| Confidently given to arbitrary users | Beyond a year |

A genuinely "Apple-like premium" distribution-quality environment is
realistically a multi-year effort or a project for a small team. These are
engineering estimates, not upstream project timelines.
